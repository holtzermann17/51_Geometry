<p class="ltx_p">Differential geometry studies geometrical objects using techniques of
calculus. In fact, its early history is indistiguishable from that of
calculus — it is a matter of personal taste whether one chooses to
regard Fermat’s method of drawing tangents and finding extrema as a
contribution to calculus or differential geometry; the pioneering work
of Barrow and Newton on calculus was presented in a geometrical
language; Halley’s 1696 paper in which he announces his discovery that
<math id="S0.SS1.p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\displaystyle\int\frac{dx}{x}=\log x+C" display="inline"><mrow><mstyle displaystyle="true"><mrow><mo largeop="true" symmetric="true">∫</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mi>x</mi></mfrac></mrow></mstyle><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>C</mi></mrow></mrow></math> is entitled quadrature of the hyperbola.</p>

<div id="S0.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">It is only later on, when calculus became more algebraic in outlook
that one can begin to make a meaningful separation between the
subjects of calculus and differential geometry. Early differential
geometers studied such properties of curves and surfaces such as:
computing their lengths and areas, finding tangents, constructing
evolute, involute, and pedal curves, studying curvature and osculating
circles, and finding envelopes and orthogonal curves to a given family
of curves. Of the various objects they studied, the cycloid deserves
special mention. Originally discovered by Galileo, it seems to have
been studied by just about every seventeenth century mathematician,
much more than any other curve. Also, it is worth mentioning that the
deep connections between differential geometry and mechanics which
play a prominent role in contemporary theoretical physics also have
their origin at this time — for instance, the fact that the problem
of geodesics on surfaces is related to the acceleration of particles
was already to known to the Bernoullis, even though the significance
of this similarity was not fully appreciated until Einstein.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">0.2 </span>Intrinsic geometry</h3>

<div id="S0.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">A major turning point in differential geometry is marked by the
appearance of Gauss’ memoir “Disquisitiones generales circa
superficies curvas”. In this memoir, Gauss first proposes the
intrinsic point of view in geometry. Since his idea of has intrinsic
geometry has completely changed the outlook of geometry, it might not
be inappropriate to spend some time discussing it.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Ordinarily, when we think of a surface such as a cylinder or a sphere,
we concieve of a locus in space (<math id="S0.SS2.p2.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{R}^{3}" display="inline"><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></math>). However, imagine
that, like blind ants crawling on a sheet, we were confined to a
surface and had no direct knowledge of the space in which the surface
was situated. What could we conclude about the surface on which we
live? Obviously, such constructions as normals to the surface or
osculating spheres which are situated in the ambient space would be
meaningless to us. However, we would be still able to speak of the
lengths of curves drawn on the surface, the angle between curves, and
areas of portions of our surface since these can be defined in terms
of measurements which are made on the surface without recourse to the
ambient space.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Considering differential geometry from this point of view, one comes
to several interesting conclusions. One is that certain surfaces,
such as a portion of a plane and a portion of a cylinder are
indistinguishable from the intrinsic point of view. This result can
be something of a surprise because one is usually accostomed to
thinking of planes and cylinders as rather different sorts of objects
— planes are flat while cylinders are curved.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">By itself this discovery is interesting, but perhaps not enough to
fire a revolution in geometry. Hearing of it, one might come to the
conclusion that intrinsic measurements alone are not sufficient to
describe the geometry of a surface and, hence, the subject of
intrinsic geometry is uninteresting. Further study shows that this is
not the case. While one may not be able to distinguish a plane from a
cylinder on the basis of intrinsic measurements alone, it is possible
to distinguish a portion of plane from a portion of sphere solely on
the basis of intrinsic measurements. Even more, it is possible to
distinguish portions of spheres of different radii intrinsically.
This, of course, is of interest not only because it shows that the
study of intrinsic geometry is non-trivial, but because a quantity
such as the radius of a sphere which is defined as the distance from a
point on the sphere to a point not on the surface (namely, the centre
of the sphere) can, in fact, be deduced solely from measurements on
the surface of the sphere.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">To prove such results, Gauss used the concept of curvature. Since the
idea of curvature, in one from or another, plays an important role in
differential geometry to this day, let us say a few words about this
key concept. The concept of curvature was developed in the eighteenth
century as a measure how much a given curve or a surface deviates from
being a straight line or a plane. In the case of a curve, the
curvature may be defined as the second derivative of the normal angle
with respect to arclength. In the case of a surface, the situation is
a little more complicated — to describe the direction of the normal
vector, one needs two angles instead of one and one can choose to
compute their directional derivatives along any direction tangent to
the surface. Because of this, one obtains a <math id="S0.SS2.p5.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="2\times 2" display="inline"><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></math> matrix of
partial derivatives instead of a single number. If one changes the
coordinates used to describe the ambient space, then the components of
this matrix will undergo a linear transformation. To obtain a
quantity which does not depend on an arbitrary choice of coordinates
and hence can be seen as describing geometric properties of the
surface, one should consider the eigenvalues of this matrix. These
eigenvalues are known as the principal curvatures of the surface.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The remarkable theorem which Gauss proved was that, whilst the
principal curvatures cannot be determined from intrinsic measurements
alone, their product can. This result, for instance, can be used to
explain the facts we mentioned about planes, cylinders, and spheres.
For a plane, the two principal curvatures equal zero. For a cylinder,
one principal curvature is zero and the other is positive. For a
sphere, both principal curvatures are equal and positive. Since the
product equals zero for both the plane and the cylinder it is
plausible that they are indistinguishable intrinsically. Since it is
not zero for the sphere, it follows from Gauss’ theorem that the
intrinsic geometry of the sphere could not possibly be the same as
that of the plane and cylinder.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">0.3 </span>The concept of a manifold</h3>

<div id="S0.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The discovery of intrinsic geometry led thoughtful geometers such as
Riemann (who was a student of Gauss), Clifford, and Mach to the
conclusion that a “right and natural” approach to geometry should
regard surfaces as geometrical spaces in their own right on a par with
Euclidean and projective space. In the terminology of the mediaeval
scholastic philosophers, one may say that they regarded the intrinsic
properties of surfaces as “essential” and extrinsic properties as
“accidental”. To properly develop geometry from such a viewpoint,
they needed to start with a definition of surface which made no
reference to any sort of ambient space. Their quest for such a
definition led to the concept of a manifold.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The genesis of this concept can be seen as a diasappearing act akin to
that of the Chesire cat — just as the grin is all that remains of
the cat when the cat disappears, so too a manifold is what remains
when one starts with a parameterized surface and the space in which
the surface is situated disappears.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">A parameterized surface may be decribed as a suitable subset <math id="S0.SS3.p3.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="S\in\mathbb{R}^{3}" display="inline"><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>∈</mo><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow></math> together with a smooth bijective map from an open subset
of <math id="S0.SS3.p3.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{R}^{2}" display="inline"><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math> to <math id="S0.SS3.p3.m3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="S" display="inline"><mi>S</mi></math> (which is called a parameterization of the
surface). Moreover, (pay careful attention because this will turn out
to be the key fact that makes the concept of a manifold possible) one
can describe the same surface using many different parameterizations.
Given two parameterizations <math id="S0.SS3.p3.m4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\phi\colon D_{1}\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}\to S" display="inline"><mrow><mi>ϕ</mi><mo>:</mo><mrow><msub><mi>D</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⊂</mo><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>→</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow></mrow></math> and <math id="S0.SS3.p3.m5" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\psi\colon D_{2}\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}\to S" display="inline"><mrow><mi>ψ</mi><mo>:</mo><mrow><msub><mi>D</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>⊂</mo><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>→</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow></mrow></math> of the same
portion of surface, the two will be related by reparametrization; that
is to say there exists a smooth bijection <math id="S0.SS3.p3.m6" class="ltx_Math" alttext="g_{\phi\psi}\colon D_{2}\to D_{1}" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>g</mi><mrow><mi>ϕ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>ψ</mi></mrow></msub><mo>:</mo><mrow><msub><mi>D</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>→</mo><msub><mi>D</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></mrow></math> such that <math id="S0.SS3.p3.m7" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\psi=\phi\circ g_{\phi\psi}" display="inline"><mrow><mi>ψ</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>ϕ</mi><mo>∘</mo><msub><mi>g</mi><mrow><mi>ϕ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>ψ</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">By contrast, a manifold may be understood as a “parameterized set”.
That is to say, a <math id="S0.SS3.p4.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><mi>n</mi></math>-dimensional manifold <math id="S0.SS3.p4.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M" display="inline"><mi>M</mi></math> is a set together with
a set of bijective maps from open sets of <math id="S0.SS3.p4.m3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{R}^{n}" display="inline"><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></math> to <math id="S0.SS3.p4.m4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M" display="inline"><mi>M</mi></math> (which
are called coordiante maps). As in the case of parameterized
surfaces, a coordinate map need not have the whole of <math id="S0.SS3.p4.m5" class="ltx_Math" alttext="M" display="inline"><mi>M</mi></math> as its
range. Moreover, we require that if two coordinate maps <math id="S0.SS3.p4.m6" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\phi\colon D_{1}\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}\to M" display="inline"><mrow><mi>ϕ</mi><mo>:</mo><mrow><msub><mi>D</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⊂</mo><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>→</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow></mrow></math> and <math id="S0.SS3.p4.m7" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\psi\colon D_{2}\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}\to M" display="inline"><mrow><mi>ψ</mi><mo>:</mo><mrow><msub><mi>D</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>⊂</mo><msup><mi>ℝ</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>→</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow></mrow></math> describe the same subset of the manifold, then
there exists a smooth bijective map <math id="S0.SS3.p4.m8" class="ltx_Math" alttext="g_{\phi\psi}\colon D_{2}\to D_{1}" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>g</mi><mrow><mi>ϕ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>ψ</mi></mrow></msub><mo>:</mo><mrow><msub><mi>D</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>→</mo><msub><mi>D</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></mrow></math>

a coordinate transformation map or a transition function.) To make
this definition completely correct, we require a few more technical
assumptions but, in keeping with the spirit of this expsition, we
shall not discuss them here and instead refer the reader to the entry
notes on the classical definition of a manifold for a careful
definition which takes technicalities into account.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">As is obvious from the definition, if we make the further assumption
that the objects of our set be points of Euclidean space and that the
correspondence between points and pairs of numbers be continuous, we
recover the definition of parameterized surface. However, we choose
to refrain from making any asumption about the nature of the elements
of our set. This freedom is exactly what allows us to regard two
surfaces with the same intrinsic geometry as the same manifold — to
obtain one surface, we specify one mapping of our set into Euclidean
space one way and to obtain the other surface we specify a different
mapping.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS3.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Objects other than surfaces can be manifolds. Most obviously, the
Euclidean plane itself is a manifold since its points can be described
by pairs of real numbers according to various coordiante systems
(Cartesian coordinates, polar coordinates, etc.) Thus, the concept of
manifold fulfills the desire of its inventors that Euclidean space and
surfaces be of the same ontological status.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Another example of a manifold is the group of affine transforms of the

<p class="ltx_p">Because of examples like the two just exhibited, it has been possible
to apply the techniques of differential geometry in some rather
unlikely settings. Once geometric notions like tangent spaces and
curvature have been defined for manifolds (we shall indicate how this
is done in the next section) then one can speak of such things as the
tangent space to the set of solutions of a differential equation or
the curvature of a group. While this may sound like a parlor stunt to
demonstrate the generality of our definitions, it is more than that.
By applying the techniques of differential geometry in such unlikely
settings, mathematicians have been able to win insights and prove
results about differential equations, groups and other mathematical
objects which otherwise seemed intractable.</p>

<div id="S0.SS3.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Before moving on to the next section, it might be worth pointing out
that, when speaking of manifolds, it is customary to refer to the
elements of the set as points and the real numbers which label them as
points. The reader should keep in mind that this is merely customary
terminology which derives from thinking of manifolds as a
generalization of parameterized surfaces and should no way be
understood as suggesting that the elements of the set which comprise
our manifold resemble points of a surface. As the examples show, they
may be functions, transformations, or other mathematical objects.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">In order to discuss such geometric notions as angles and lengths and

<div id="S0.SS4.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Using this procedure, one can define all sorts of structures on
manifolds, of which we shall consider only two more examples here.
One example is the vector field. A vector field may be defined as the
assignment of a vector to every point in the manifold. Given a
coordinate system, we may specify such an entity by assigning an
<math id="S0.SS4.p7.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><mi>n</mi></math>-tuple of numbers to every point. In other words, in a coordinate
system our vector field is represented by an <math id="S0.SS4.p7.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><mi>n</mi></math>-tuple of functions.
Upon making a change of coordinates, these <math id="S0.SS4.p7.m3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><mi>n</mi></math>-tuples change according
to the law presented earlier.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS4.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The second example is the metric field. Recall that in our discussion
of intrinsic geometry, we considered measuring lengths and angles
along the surface. Now, in Euclidean geometry, we may define the
notions of length and angle in terms of an inner product. A metric
field may be described as the assignment of an inner product for
tangent vectors to every point of the manifold. Given a basis, an
inner product can be described by a symmetric, positive-definite
matrix. Hence, to define the notion of metric field, we will consider
the assignment of a symmetric, positive definite matrix of functions
to every coordinate system in such a way that the matrices assigned to
two coordinate systems are related according to the transformation law
for inner products under a change of basis.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS4.p9" class="ltx_para">

<div id="S0.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In order to understand the toatality of all possible tangents vectors,
metrics, etc. one typically collects them into larger structures
called sheaves and bundles. To understand how such constructions
proceed, we will start by examining the fundamental example of the
tangent bundle.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Last section, we desribed how a tangent vector is described in an
intrinsic manner. Suppose we now want to consider the totality of all
tangent vectors to a manifold. We could start by picking a point of
the manifold and considering all tangent vectors based at that point.
Since it is meaningful to make linear combinations of tangent vectors
with the same basepoint, the set of all tangent vectors with a common
basepoint forms a vector space called the tangent space to the
manifold at that point. As we saw earlier, vector spaces are
manifolds because one can impose coordinates on a vector space by
choosing a basis.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">So our problem of describing the toality of all tangent vectors
reduces to the problem of describing the totality of all tangent
spaces. We claim that they form a manifold. Basically, the reason
for this is that, to specify a tangent vector, we could give the
coordinates of its basepoint with respect to a coordinate system on
the manifold and specify which vector by its coordnates with respect
to a basis for the tangent space at that point. This manifold whose
points are tangent vectors to a certain manifold is known as the
tangent bundle of the orginal manifold.</p>
